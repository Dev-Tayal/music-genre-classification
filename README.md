# 🎵 Music Genre Classification with CNN

This project classifies music into genres using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on MFCCs extracted from audio files.

## 📁 Dataset
GTZAN dataset - downloaded from Kaggle.

## 🔧 Tools
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Librosa
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 🚀 Run
1. Upload your `kaggle.json` and download the dataset
2. Preprocess using Librosa
3. Train the CNN on MFCC features
4. Evaluate and save the model

## 📊 Accuracy
Achieved XX% test accuracy (update based on your result)

## 📁 Output
- `data.json` – processed MFCCs
- `genre_classification_cnn.h5` – trained model
